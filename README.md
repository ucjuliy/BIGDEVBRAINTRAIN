**All imputed variables used in the training study can be found in file *Masterspreadsheet_AllVariables.csv* under the main folder**

**data overview**
Data in each domain was computed seperatedly under each domain folder. Raw data can be found under file name *raw_variablename.csv* or *raw_variablename.xlsx* in each folder; imputed data can be found under file name *imputed_variablename.csv* in each folder. Code used to impute the data can be found under file name *imputation_variablename.R*. 
  
For example:  
**Academic Performance**  
File *raw_academic_score.csv* contains raw data of academic score. File *imputed_academic_score* contains imputed academic performance data. File *imputation_academic_score.R* contains the code necessary for imputation.   
**Brain Measures**  
File *raw_brain_measures.csv* contains raw data of all brain data. File *imputed_brain_measures* contains imputed brain measures. File *imputation_brain.R* contains the code necessary for imputation. Individual raw brain data files can be found under folder Full ROIs.   
**Creativity**  
File *raw_creativity.csv* contains raw data of creativity. File *imputed_creativity.csv* contains imputed creativity score. File *imputation_creativity.R* contains the code necessary for imputation.   
**Decision Making**  
File *raw_decision_making.csv* contains raw data of decision making related variables. File *imputed_decision_making.csv* contains imputed decision making related variables. File *imputation_decision_making.R* contains the code necessary for imputation.  
**Executive Function**  
Raw Executive Function has three files depending on the EF variables: *raw_EF_ERROR.csv*, *raw_EF_RT.csv*, *raw_EF_threetimepoints.csv*. Imputed data can be found under *imputed_EF_ERROR.csv*, *imputed_EF_RT.csv*, *imputed_EF_threetimepoints.csv*. File *imputation_executive_functions.R* contains the code necessary for imputation. 
In addition, for executive functions, factor analysis was also conduced on T0 variables and the results can be found in file *EF_Factor_T0.csv* for three factors and *EF_2factor.csv* for two factors.  
**WASI**  
File *raw_wasi.csv* contains raw data of wasi scores. File *imputed_wasi.csv* contains imputed wasi scores. File *imputation_wasi.R* contains the code necessary for imputation.  

  
For **Mental Health** and **Executive Function** related factor analysis:  
Imputed factor variables can be found in files *MENTALHEALTHFACTORS.csv* under mental health folder and *EF_Factor_T0.csv* for three factors and *EF_2factor.csv* for two factors.
